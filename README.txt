This application is a minimum viable product. I originally built it as a proof-of-concept for the co-founders of a startup called Amano.

While I no longer work for Amano, I continue to add updates to the application under a new, fictional company name. It is not my intention to compete with Amano.
I have their permission to use the re-branded applicaton for portfolio purposes.

THE CONCEPT: Pool technicians spend a great deal of their time driving through their route taking pool level measurements. The number of clients they can take on
is limited by the amount of time it takes to periodically visit each pool, take measurements, and make adjustments. Amano provides small devices that float in a pool
and take care of the measurements. Technicians can see the pH, alkalinity, and chlorine levels for each pool they manage without having to make a visit. This allows
them to visit only the pools needing attention and frees up time to add more clients to their roster.
